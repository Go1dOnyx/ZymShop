        <p>
            We are a small group of individuals working in developing a small ecommerce store
            selling our own merchandise of graphic tees and varies clothing. Our plan is to 
            expand into an enterprise business that can sell items other than clothing that
            can even include items from our own clients. This application first started as a 
            small portfolio project to help land a job as Software Developers, but I (Jesus Diaz)
            grew an interest in actually making an official store selling my art through shirts.
